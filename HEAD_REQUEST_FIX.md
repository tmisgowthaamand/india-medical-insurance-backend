# HEAD Request 405 Error Fix

## Problem
```
ERROR:error_handler:HTTP Exception: 405 - Method Not Allowed
ERROR:error_handler:Request: HEAD http://india-medical-insurance-backend.onrender.com/
```

## Root Cause
- Render's health check system uses HEAD requests to monitor service health
- Your FastAPI endpoints only supported GET requests
- HEAD requests to `/` and `/health` returned 405 Method Not Allowed

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added HEAD Method Support
Updated `backend/app.py` to support HEAD requests on key endpoints:

```python
# Root endpoint - now supports both GET and HEAD
@app.get("/")
@app.head("/")
def root():
    return {"message": "India Medical Insurance ML Dashboard API", "version": "1.0.0"}

# Health check endpoint - now supports both GET and HEAD  
@app.get("/health")
@app.head("/health")
def health_check():
    # ... health check logic
```

### 2. Added Universal HEAD Handler
Added a catch-all HEAD handler for any other endpoints:

```python
@app.head("/{path:path}")
def head_handler(path: str):
    """Handle HEAD requests for health checks and monitoring"""
    return {}
```

### 3. CORS Already Configured
CORS middleware already includes HEAD in allowed methods:
```python
allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS", "HEAD"]
```

## What This Fixes

### Before (Error State)
- ❌ HEAD requests return 405 Method Not Allowed
- ❌ Render health checks fail
- ❌ Error logs show HTTP 405 exceptions
- ❌ Monitoring systems can't properly check service health

### After (Fixed State)
- ✅ HEAD requests return 200 OK
- ✅ Render health checks work properly
- ✅ No more 405 errors in logs
- ✅ Monitoring systems can check service health

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Test
```bash
# Test HEAD request to root endpoint
curl -I https://india-medical-insurance-backend.onrender.com/

# Test HEAD request to health endpoint
curl -I https://india-medical-insurance-backend.onrender.com/health

# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK (not 405)
```

### Automated Test
```bash
cd backend
python test_head_requests.py
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Code is already updated** ✅
2. **Deploy to Render**:
   - Render will auto-deploy from your git repository
   - Or manually trigger deployment in Render dashboard
3. **Verify fix**:
   - Check Render logs for absence of 405 errors
   - Run test script to confirm HEAD requests work

## Why HEAD Requests Matter

- **Health Checks**: Render uses HEAD requests to monitor service health
- **Load Balancers**: Many load balancers prefer HEAD for health checks
- **Monitoring**: External monitoring services often use HEAD requests
- **Performance**: HEAD requests are lighter than GET (no response body)

## Success Indicators

✅ No more "405 - Method Not Allowed" errors in logs  
✅ Render service shows as healthy  
✅ `curl -I` commands return 200 status  
✅ Health check endpoints respond to HEAD requests  

## Related HTTP Methods Supported

- **GET**: Regular requests with response body
- **POST**: Data submission (signup, login, etc.)
- **PUT**: Data updates
- **DELETE**: Data deletion
- **OPTIONS**: CORS preflight requests
- **HEAD**: Health checks and monitoring (newly added)

The fix ensures your MediCare+ backend is fully compatible with modern deployment platforms and monitoring systems.
