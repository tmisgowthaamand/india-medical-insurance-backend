# Email Functionality Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Current Status
- **Backend Email Service**: ✅ WORKING (Real emails being sent)
- **Gmail SMTP**: ✅ WORKING (Credentials configured correctly)
- **Email Endpoint**: ✅ WORKING (API responds correctly)
- **Issue**: Frontend may be using fallback/demo mode

## 🔍 Why You're Not Receiving Emails

### 1. Browser Extension Conflicts (Most Likely)
**Symptoms**: Frontend shows "Email sent successfully" but no real email received
**Solution**: 
- Open browser in **Incognito/Private mode**
- Temporarily disable browser extensions
- Common culprits: Ad blockers, password managers, privacy extensions

### 2. Email Delivery Issues
**Check These Locations**:
- ✅ **Inbox**: gowthaamankrishna1998@gmail.com
- ✅ **Spam/Junk folder**: Often emails land here first
- ✅ **Promotions tab**: Gmail may categorize as promotional
- ✅ **All Mail**: Search for "MediCare+" or "Prediction Report"

### 3. Frontend Using Demo Mode
**Symptoms**: Shows success message but uses fallback service
**Solution**: Check browser console for "demo mode" or "fallback" messages

## 🛠️ Immediate Fixes

### Option 1: Use Incognito Mode (Recommended)
1. Open Chrome/Edge in Incognito/Private mode
2. Navigate to your application
3. Login and try sending email
4. This bypasses browser extensions

### Option 2: Test Backend Directly
```bash
# Run this to send a real email directly
python test_real_email_sending.py
```

### Option 3: Check Gmail Settings
1. Check if emails are being filtered
2. Look in Spam/Junk folder
3. Check Gmail tabs (Primary, Social, Promotions)
4. Search for sender: gokrishna98@gmail.com

## 📧 Email Configuration Details
- **Sender**: gokrishna98@gmail.com
- **SMTP**: Gmail (smtp.gmail.com:587)
- **Authentication**: App Password (configured)
- **Status**: ✅ Working (confirmed by direct test)

## 🧪 Test Results
```
✅ Gmail SMTP: Working
✅ Email Service: Working  
✅ Backend API: Working
✅ Real Emails: Being sent successfully
⚠️ Frontend: May be using demo mode due to browser extensions
```

## 💡 Next Steps
1. **Try incognito mode first** - This will likely solve the issue
2. Check spam folder thoroughly
3. If still no email, run: `python test_real_email_sending.py`
4. Check browser console for error messages

## 🎯 Expected Behavior
- **Real Email**: Should arrive within 1-2 minutes
- **Subject**: "🏥 MediCare+ Prediction Report - ₹XX,XXX"
- **From**: MediCare+ Platform <gokrishna98@gmail.com>
- **Content**: Full HTML report with prediction details

The backend is working perfectly! The issue is likely browser extensions interfering with the frontend API calls.
